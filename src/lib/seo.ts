export const FAQS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "What does ProofMyAI do?", a: "ProofMyAI is a quality monitor for AI and automations. It checks every answer your AI chatbot gives against your own help docs, watches AI agents for loops, errors and runaway costs, lets you approve risky agent actions with one click, and monitors n8n and Make workflows, Google Sheets and CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce for failures and silent failures. A trust report shows where your AI can decide alone, and when something breaks you get an alert and a clear fix list." },
  { q: "Which chatbots and tools does it work with?", a: "Any of them, on any AI model: Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama and others. Connect Intercom Fin directly, WhatsApp bots through WAHA or Twilio, or upload chat exports from Zendesk, Tidio, Crisp, Chatbase or your own bot. Send AI agent runs from LangChain, OpenAI Agents, Claude or CrewAI with one API call, connect n8n or Make with an API key, watch Google Sheets with a link, and connect HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, GoHighLevel and other CRMs read-only." },
  { q: "How does it detect AI hallucinations?", a: "An AI judge (Claude or Google Gemini) compares each answer with your knowledge base and labels it correct, not in the docs, made up, should escalate to a human, off policy or unclear. Rule-based checks catch invented prices, missed escalations and over-promises even without an AI key." },
  { q: "Do I need to write code?", a: "No. Chatbot audits only need a file upload, n8n, Make and CRMs connect with an API key or token, Google Sheets with a link, and alerts go to WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, Teams or email. Developers can use the API for live tracking, the pre-send check and approvals." },
  { q: "Is my customers' data safe?", a: "Personal data such as emails, phone numbers, card numbers, IBANs, UK postcodes, number plates and names is masked automatically before anything is stored or sent to an AI model, and you can add your own words to mask. Each project can keep results only (no conversation text), delete data automatically after 7 to 365 days, or switch the AI provider off. A GDPR / UK GDPR Data Processing Agreement is available, and self-hosting is possible for regulated businesses." },
  { q: "Can agencies use it for clients?", a: "Yes. Create one project per client, share read-only client reports with your own agency name, export PDF and CSV, and send weekly summary emails. The Agency plan covers up to 20 client projects." },
  { q: "How much does it cost?", a: "ProofMyAI is free for 50 conversations a month. Paid plans start at $29 per month, and the Compliance plan for regulated businesses is $249. Pay yearly and get 2 months free (12 months for the price of 10). Every paid plan has a 14-day free trial and a 14-day money-back guarantee." },
  { q: "What is a silent failure in n8n or Make?", a: "A silent failure is a workflow run that reports success but produced nothing, for example an order sync that returned zero orders because an API changed. ProofMyAI flags these, along with failed runs, slow runs, error spikes and workflows that stopped running." },
